                Footballers across Europe’s top leagues are playing an abundant number of games when taking international fixtures into consideration, as well as pre-season friendlies.
                <br> <!-- this creates a line breaker-->
                <br>
                A top footballer earns on average £50000-£60000 pounds per game played. For a footballer playing 50+ games a season for club and country, they would receive a rather bountiful £2,500,000-£3,000,000 a year for their efforts. However, if the same footballer played 40 games a season for the same amount per game, their yearly salary goes down.
                <br>
                <br>

                FIFpro recommends footballers play a maximum of 55 games a season for club and country. There are footballers who can and do play more, but their physical abilities are almost superhuman, and are the exception rather than the rule. Other footballers face the prospect of a shorter career.
                <br>
                <br>

                Mohammed Salah and Sadio Mane played almost 70 games for Liverpool and their countries in the 2021–22 season, with 60% of appearances in the “critical zone”, as what FIFpro considers back-to-back games.

                <p>
                    The 2023/24 season saw a continuation of many of the recent trends in injury data. Overall, injury burdens have gotten bigger for clubs as the footballing authorities ignore the warnings around player use and the increasingly congested football calendar. This has thrown up some fascinating discoveries about trends within the Premier League that will be analysed and explored. As always, injuries are not black and white. Just because a club has a high amount of injuries it does not automatically mean that their backroom staff should come under criticism; instead, there are a lot of factors at play that will be discussed.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Looking at the total lost time injuries (an injury sustained while playing or training that results in the loss of productive work time), we can see that only five teams in the league have managed to improve their injury burden. These improvements are almost fairly minimal but overall the Premier League has seen 67 more lost time injuries compared to last season. The fact that almost all teams have regressed emphasises what many have warned about: players are suffering from being worked too hard.
                    Most impressive team among lost time injuries was Bournemouth. They had a 27% decrease in lost time injuries this season while also having their best-ever Premier League finish. Their amazing squad availability may also be the reason behind their fortunes in the league as it allowed them to be consistent with their tactics and personnel.

                    “The schedule is completely crazy. We’ve just received the news that we only have one day off for the English League Cup game,We’ll probably play every three days for months. It’s been absolutely absurd. In the Champions League, if you don’t qualify for the round of 16 you still have to play two more game.It’s true that the squads are bigger, but I’m not going to say that it’s easy. It hasn’t been easy. I spend very little time with my family and friends. The amount of games we’re subjected to is absolutely absurd.”
